title: NuShell map from functional languages
prev: Imperative map 
next: Operator map

The idea behind this table is to help you understand how NuShell built-ins and plug-ins relate to functional languages. We've tried to produce a map of all the nushell commands and what their equivalents are in other languages. Contributions are welcome.

Note: this table assumes Nushell 0.13.1 or later.
